    <h3> WHat does HTTP do?</h3>
    <p> 
HTTP is stateless by default, each request is independent, however tools like cookies help gather data that may be useful (Barth, 2011). It also supports secure connections between the client and the server. Data is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) / SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) preventing any issues during transit. Encryption and Authentication are both key structures in TLS (Transport Layer Security) / SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol (Developers, HTTP: MDN). HTTP also provides mechanisms for identifying and retrieving web resources through URI (Uniform Resource Identifiers) (Berners-Lee et al., 2005).
</p>

<h3>HTTP in the early 2010s</h3>
<p>
    In the early 2010s Google developed SPDY which directly influenced HTTP 2 with its features like binary framing, multiplexing, header compression, and server push features that dramatically improved web performance (Belshe et al., 2015). HTTP 2, adopted a binary framing layer, multiplexing, and server push while maintaining compatibility with HTTP 1.1, marking a major leap forward in web performance (Belshe et al., 2015). Google also continued with renovating with QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), first made in 2013, which focused on TCP's (Transmission Control Protocol) restrictions by using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) adding encryption at the transport layer, ultimately forming the basis for HTTP/3 (Langley et al., 2017).  The adjustment of HTTP 3 in 2022 represented another pattern shift, moving away from TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) entirely in favor of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) to reduce inactivity and improve performance on unreliable networks (Bishop, 2022).
</p>

<h3> How was it changing? </h3>
<p>
     Throughout its evolution, HTTP has been designed by the changing needs of the web, from document retrieval to complex applications, with each version addressing the limitations of its past versions while maintaining the protocol's ultimate values of simplicity and extensibility. The development of HTTP has been guided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with significant contributions from browser vendors, web companies, and researchers, ensuring its continued relevance as the foundation of web communication (Nottingham, 2020).
